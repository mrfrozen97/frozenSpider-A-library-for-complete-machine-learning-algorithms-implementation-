# ML-Algorithms-Python3-Library
This is a library that does all the heavy lifting for the basic ml algorithms such as regression, knn, svm, etc. But, currently this has only linear regression, logisti regression, Naive bayes, knn, K-means cluster along with animation and some data visualisation algorithms. But in fututre I would extend this projects to ......... The speciality about this library is you can plot the outcomes on graph in a single line using class included in the library. Which is fed with default parameters. Which you can change according to your requirements.It uses the following libraries 1) Numpy 2) Matplotlib. Currently the neural network part is under development......

Release v 0.0.4
It has new reinforcement learning ssection. Currently it implements deep-q learning but other algorithms will be added soon.
